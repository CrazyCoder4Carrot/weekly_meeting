# Mafia Week 2
11/27/2016, Presented by **Zhenbang Liu** and ** Hongqiao Li**.

This week, Liu talked about consistency of distribution system. Li focused on sharing knowledge with different Knapsack problems.
## Knapsack Problems
There are kinds of Knapsack problems but the following three is typical.
### 0/1 Knapsack
Given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights of n items. Also, given an integer W which represents bag capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You can either pick the complete item, or don’t pick it.

A simple brute force solution is to calculate all the subsets of the values such that the sum of their weight is less than W, then find the maximum value subset. The subsets of an array with n elements is 2^n. When n becomes large, it's not a better way to solve this problem. Any optimal solution? The answer is definite. We can use the dynamic problem to solve this problem.
#### Optimal solution-Dynamic Solution
For each items in the array, there are two cases: 1) included in the optimal subset,2) not included in the optimal subset. Thus, we can get the optimal solutions for their subproblems, so the definition of `dp[i][j]` can be as follows:

1) Maximum value obtained by `(i-1)` items and `j` weight, the `ith` item not included.

2) Maximum value obtained by `(i-1)` items and `(j-weight of the ith item)`, the `ith` item included.

The following shares two ways of the dynamic implementation.
#### Top-down recursion
```python
def knapSack_top(wts,vals,n,maxw):
    if n==0 or maxw==0:
        return 0
    # If weight of the nth item is more than capacity.
    # it can't be included
    if (wts[n-1]>maxw):
        return knapSack_top(wts,vals,n-1,maxw)
    else:
        return max(val[n-1]+knapSack_top(wts,vals,n-1,maxw-wts[n-1]),
                   knapSack_top(wts,vals,n-1,maxw))
```
#### Bottom-up memorization
```python
def knapSack_bottom(wts,vals,maxw):
    n=len(vals)
    if n==0 or maxw==0:
        return 0
    dp=[[0 for _ in xrange(maxw+1)] for _ in xrange(n+1)]

    for i in xrange(1,n+1):
        for j in xrange(maxw+1):
            if wts[i-1]<=j:
                dp[i][j]=max(dp[i-1][j],dp[i-1][j-wts[i-1]]+vals[i-1])
            else:
                dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j]
    return dp[n][maxw]
```
Total time complexity is `O(n*maxW)`, we can do the space optimal work when you understand how it works.
### Unbounded Knapsack
Unbounded means that there are infinite item available for each item.In other words, given a bag with capacity with W, picking as many items into the knapsack such that the sum of the items is maximized. We can define the problem as follows:
```
n1 means the number of type 1 packed into the knapsack
n2 means the number of type 2 packed into the knapsack
...
ni means the number of type i packed into the knapsack

Total weight of packed item=w1×n1+w2×n2+...+wi×ni.
Total value of packed item=v1×n1+v2×n2+...+vi×ni.
So the problem is: max the v1×n1+v2×n2+...+vi×ni such that w1×n1+w2×n2+...+wi×ni<=W.
```
#### Top-down recursion
We can divide the problem into smaller problems when using recursion to solving this kind of problem. Suppose we choose `first item` 1 with `w1` into  the bag, we can delegate the subproblems which is to max the total value with `W-w1` for others to solve. Other items can be considered as the similar situation. Based on the subprolems, I can solve the original problem with as follows: 
```
subsol1=maximum total value with `W-w1`. 
final1=the first item packed was item 1
final1=subsol1+v1
...

Max value=max(final1,final2,final2...finali)
```
Based on the above, the `divide and conquer` solution for the unbounded knapsack problem:
```python
def unbound_knapSack_top(wts,vals,maxw):
    n=len(vals)
    subsol=[0 for _ in xrange(n)]
    finsol=[0 for _ in xrange(n)]

    # base case
    if maxw==0:
        return 0

    # smaller problem using recursion
    for i in xrange(n):
        if wts[i]<=maxw:
            # capacity reduce by wts[i] since it already has item i
            subsol[i]=unbound_knapSack_top(wts,vals,maxw-wts[i])

    # based on the above solution, solve the original problem
    for i in xrange(n):
        if wts[i]<=maxw:
            # capacity reduce by wts[i] since it already has item i
            finsol[i]=subsol[i]+vals[i]

    # find the maximum
    return max(finsol)
```
Also, we can solve this problem using `dynamic problem`. It's much similiar with recusive solution. Every time the `maxw` has change by the `parameter` to call the recusive method. 

#### Bottom-up memorization
```python
def unbound_knapSack_bottom(wts,vals,maxw):
    n=len(vals)
    subsol=[0 for _ in xrange(n)]
    finsol=[0 for _ in xrange(n)]
    # to save the recursive result
    dp=[0 for _ in xrange(maxw+1)]

    # base case
    if maxw==0:
        return 0

    for submaxw in xrange(1,maxw+1):
        # inner part is the recusive code
        for i in xrange(n):
            if wts[i]<=submaxw:
                # capacity reduce by wts[i] since it already has item i
                subsol[i]=dp[submaxw-wts[i]]

        # based on the above solution, solve the original problem
        for i in xrange(n):
            if wts[i]<=submaxw:
                # capacity reduce by wts[i] since it already has item i
                finsol[i]=subsol[i]+vals[i]

        # find the maximum for the submaxw
        dp[submaxw]=max(finsol)
    return dp[maxw]
```
Based on the above main loops, it's easy to see that the total time complexity is `O(n*w)`.
