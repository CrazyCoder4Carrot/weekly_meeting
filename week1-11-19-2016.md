# Mafia Week 1
11/19/2016, Presented by **Zhenbang Liu** and ** Zheng Yang**.

This week, Liu talked about SQL vs. NoSQL and a highly available distributed system Dynamo. Also, Yang shared some typical graph interview questions and algorithms.
## SQL&NoSQL
### Features
Liu talked about the differences between SQL and NoSQL. SQL stores as a table while NoSQL usually documents as JSON file. SQL has primary keys, indexes, relationships, triggers and stored procedures, but NoSQL has no such features. SQL do normalization in most scenarios, however, NoSQL uses denormalization to improve the read performance. A sample of NoSQL JSON could be like this:
```json
{
  ISBN: 9780992461225,
  title: "JavaScript: Novice to Ninja",
  author: "Darren Jones",
  format: "ebook",
  price: 29.00
}
```
We also covered SQL join, data integrity, performance and scaling when comparing the two. The ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) get involved when discussing different scenarios.
### Summary
#### SQL
* Logical related discrete data requirements which can be identified up-front.
* Data integrity is essential.
* Standards-based proven technology with good developer experience and support.
#### NoSQL
* Unrelated, indeterminate or evolving data requirements.
* Simpler or looser project objectives, able to start coding immediately.
* Speed and scalability is imperative.

## Dynamo
### What it is
Dynamo is a highly available distributed key-value storage system. It sacrifices consistency for availability. Also, using synthesis of well known techniques, such as consistent hashing, object versioning, conflict resolution to achieve scalability and availability. In practical, some of Amazon's key product use this system. It's friendly to scale up and flexible for many apps. But it depends on the following assumptions and requirements:
* Simple query model
* No ACID properties
* Stringent latency requirements
* Non-hostile environment

Next, we talked the SLAs(Service Level Agreements), consistency and heterogeneity. At last, the variant of consistent hashing and vector clock have been explained in details with two examples.

## Algorithm
In the second part, Yang shared us with several typical graph and mathematical problem.

### Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array
The original descripiton of this question is [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-of-two-numbers-in-an-array/), I strongly recommend you to try this yourself first. To solve this problem, we need to identify the MSB(most significant bit) when doing the XOR operation. The `Trie` is a better to solve this problem. If you don't have much experience of  `Trie`. There is a way using bit manipulation. It's also start to identify the MSB in those numbers.

For example, if we have an array of `[14,10,7,2]` and the binary format would be `[1110, 1010, 0111, 0010]`. Let's start with MSB=3. The mask for MSB=3 is `1000`. Using a hashset to record all the value of `num&mask`, so the set contains `[1000,0000]`. At this time, the maximum candidate could be `1000` since we can find two values XOR `1000^0000` equals the maximum. For next iteration, we try the MSB=2 and the mask is `1100`. And the result would be like this:
```
Array=[1110, 1010, 0111, 0010]
i=3 mask=1000  set={1000,0000} candicate=1000, max=1000
i=2 mask=1100  set={1100,1000,0100,0000} candicate=1100, max=1100
i=1 mask=1110  set={1110,1010,0110,0010} candicate=1110, can't find two value XOR equal candicate, max remains 1100
i=0 mask=1111  set={1110, 1011, 0111, 0010} candicate=1111, can't find two value XOR equal candicate, max remains 1100
```
And the code could be like:
```python
def findMaximumXOR(nums):
        mask=maxnum=0
        for i in xrange(31,-1,-1):
            mask|=1<<i
            hashset=set()
            # get each most significant bit
            for num in nums:
                hashset.add(num&mask)
            # for the maxnum candicate, try to find each bit
            candicate=maxnum|(1<<i)
            # for each bit hashset, if the pre and candicate^pre in hashset
            # candidate (candicate^pre^pre) should be the maxnum
            for pre in hashset:
                if candicate^pre in hashset:
                    maxnum=candicate
        return maxnum
```

## Q&A
### What happens when type `www.google.com` in browser?
It's a big problem if we cover any detail of the techniques involved. As discussed in the meeting, we will only summary the general process for the problem. Also, different browser might have different URL parser to solving the HTTPS s or HTTP requests. If we type without `https://` or `http://`, some of the browsers won't work. The chrome will parse the protocol, server and port. For the general discussion, the process would be as follows:

**1. Record request**

When visting 'www.google.com', the computer will check the local DNS cache first. If it stores the value, it won't try to get access to remote DNS server.

**2. Request the DNS record recursively**

If the browser can't get the DNS record locally, the computer will query the DNS record on the setting DNS server. If not setting, the queries will default go to the ISP's, such as Version, DNS servers. It provides the DNS queries for their backbone network. They all have caches, if the record found, the query will end before checking the record in the next level.

**3. Query the root DNS servers**

If the ISP servers has no such records, the query will try to connect the root nameservers. Usually, there are 13 TLD(top-level domains) servers which includes `.com`,`.net`,`.edu`, etc. Since the request ends with `.com`, the `.com` server will handle the query. It will not store single domain record. Instead, it will redirect the queries to the next level authoritative nameservers `google.com`. 

**4. Query the authoritative DNS servers**

The authoritative servers store different types of DNS records. There are four types for most usage: `A`,`CNAME`,`MX` and `NS`. Records format would be `name, value, type, ttl)`.
* `A`: hostname:IP, (dns1.google.com, 1.1.1.1, A).
* `CNAME`: name is alias name for the real name, (www.ibm.com,servereast.backup2.ibm.com).
* `NS`: name is domain, value is hostname of authoritative name server(google.com,www.google.com).
* `MX`: value is name of mailserver associated with name.
 
The recursive server queries the authoritative nameservers and request the host record for `www.google.com`. The recursive DNS server receives the host record for `www.google.com` from the authoritative nameservers, and stores the record in its local cache. If others request the same record, the servers won't go through the query again until the record expires.

**5. Get the IP address**

At last, the server response the DNS records to the computer. Computer will store the record in local cache and then pass the query info to the browser. 

**6. Building connection**

After getting the IP address, the browser will try to build the connection between the target server. For `HTTP`,  port normally will be `80` and `HTTPS` could be `443`. If the interviewers want to discuss the `HTTPS`, we can go deep to talk how to build connections based on `SSL/TLS`. Right now, I want to pay attention to `HTTP`.

**7. HTTP Requests**

The browser will send the HTTP request through the TCP connection and waiting for the responses from the servers. 
When receiving the responses, it will identify the response based on the code, such as 200,505 or 404. If the response objects can be cached, store them locally. Finally, browser will render the responses and show the pages or images.

To make all the process in details, it might take much time to do. There are lots things happening at the same time. For `HTTPS`, the situation could be more complex, key distribution, certificates identify, signature, etc. If you are interested in all the topics, please Google and learn when you are free.

### Design Problem
**Give 3 web servers, 3 caches, 1 load balancer and 1 database, design an architecture to make advantage all of them.**

For this problem, I think it might be simple to put the components in the right place without caches. The top level should be the `Load Balancer`. The next level is `three web servers`. The `Database` could be in the bottom. Now, the question is how to take advantage of the three caches. I think there are no best way to design this architecture when the scenario changes. I want to share how to solve the key questions with caching. Generally, we can cache objects, pages, API and sessions.  Here are what I am thinking for the three caches. Due to the limitation of the machines, we can't avoid the single point failure, but we can make other performance better.

*** Caching back-end **

The load balancer checks cache-backend, If cache hit, returns the requested content to the load balancer and then returns requested data to the user. If miss, go to the normal steps.

*** Caching session **

One big problem when we build web apps is sticky sessions. We can take advantage of the caching to build a session store. Thus, no matter what the request goes to, the different web severs can get the session data. 

*** Caching quries **

The read would be more frequent in most case. The query in DB is expensive, especially when the table is large. Caching can save lots of time when it tries to access database at the same queries.
