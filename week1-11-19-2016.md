# Mafia Week 1
11/19/2016, Presented by **Zhenbang Liu** and ** Zheng Yang**.

This week, Liu talked about SQL vs. NoSQL and a highly available distributed system Dynamo. Also, Yang shared some typical graph interview questions and algorithms.
## SQL&NoSQL
### Features
We talked about the differences between SQL and NoSQL. SQL stores as a table while NoSQL usually documents as JSON file. SQL has primary keys, indexes, relationships, triggers and stored procedures, but NoSQL has no such features. SQL do normalization in most scenarios, however, NoSQL uses denormalization to improve the read performance. A sample of NoSQL JSON could be like this:
```json
{
  ISBN: 9780992461225,
  title: "JavaScript: Novice to Ninja",
  author: "Darren Jones",
  format: "ebook",
  price: 29.00
}
```
We also covered SQL join, data integrity, performance and scaling when comparing the two. The ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) get involved when discussing different scenarios.
### Summary
#### SQL
* Logical related discrete data requirements which can be identified up-front.
* Data integrity is essential.
* Standards-based proven technology with good developer experience and support.
#### NoSQL
* Unrelated, indeterminate or evolving data requirements.
* Simpler or looser project objectives, able to start coding immediately.
* Speed and scalability is imperative.

## Dynamo
### What it is
Dynamo is a highly available distributed key-value storage system. It sacrifices consistency for availability. Also, using synthesis of well known techniques, such as consistent hashing, object versioning, conflict resolution to achieve scalability and availability. In practical, some of Amazon's key product use this system. It's friendly to scale up and flexible for many apps. But it depends on the following assumptions and requirements:
* Simple query model
* No ACID properties
* Stringent latency requirements
* Non-hostile environment

Next, we talked the SLAs(Service Level Agreements), consistency and heterogeneity. At last, the variant of consistent hashing and vector clock have been explained in details with two examples.

## Suggestion

Here is the list of Trie problems in the Leetcode:

336	Palindrome Pairs 	23.9%	Hard	
421	Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array	38.0%	Medium	
208	Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) 	25.6%	Medium	
212	Word Search II	21.8%	Hard	
211	Add and Search Word - Data structure design	20.1%	Medium	
425	Word Squares 	40.0%	Hard	

Come on and solve them.
